## 📚 Under the Hood: Core Web Concepts

Building a fast, interactive web application requires a strong understanding of how the browser engine processes code and handles interactions. Below are the core concepts that power web applications like TodoFlow.

### 🏗️ The Critical Rendering Path
How the browser converts raw code into a functional visual interface:

1. **Parsing:** The browser reads the raw bytes of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript and translates them into a format the browser engine understands. It pauses HTML parsing if it encounters synchronous scripts.
2. **Tokenization:** The raw string of HTML characters is converted into distinct tokens (e.g., `<html>`, `<body>`) as defined by the W3C standard.
3. **DOM Tree (Document Object Model):** The tokens are linked together into a tree data structure representing the document's hierarchy.
4. **CSSOM Tree (CSS Object Model):** The browser parses CSS and builds a secondary tree that maps out how each DOM node should be styled.
5. **Render Tree:** The DOM and CSSOM trees are combined. The Render Tree contains only the nodes required to render the page visually (e.g., elements with `display: none` are excluded).

### ⚡ JavaScript Event Mechanisms
How interactions (like clicking "Delete Task") are routed through the DOM:

1. **Event Capturing (Trickling):** The event starts at the highest level (`Window`, `Document`) and propagates downwards through the ancestors until it reaches the exact target element.
2. **Event Bubbling:** Once the event reaches the target element, it "bubbles" back upwards through its ancestors until it reaches the root. 
3. **Event Delegation:** A crucial performance optimization. Instead of attaching a new event listener to every single task `<li>` (which consumes memory), a single listener is attached to the parent `<ul>`. By utilizing Event Bubbling, the parent listener catches the click, checks the `event.target`, and processes the edit or delete action seamlessly for all current and future tasks.
